  As a developer I enjoy building and improving applications which solve problems and improve access for clients and customers. I pride myself on my versatility and flexibility, being more than capable at a variety of frontend, backend and devops tasks.

  I am an active presence in the community and help organise and attend as much as my calendar can allow. Working for a company that shares my passion for learning and teaching is an important aim of mine and teaching is something I would like to do more of in the future.

  Recently I have been referred to as the company's 'early warning system' in reference to my ability to flag potential issues ahead of time, identify areas of improvement within working processes and provide support to co-workers before problems arise.

  I enjoy beach football and being in and around a stage as a technician and a improvised comedian as a way of maintaining a healthy work / life balance.
